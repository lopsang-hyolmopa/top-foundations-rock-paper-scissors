This is a foundations Rock, Paper Scissors game project of The Odin Project (TOP) under JS section. After completing this project, I learned fundamentals of JS such as string, array, founctions, and more. Additionally, I learned about mapping concepts while creating winConditons object. It helped me to make code more organized and easier to understand.
